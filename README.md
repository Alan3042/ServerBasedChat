# ServerBasedChat


ServerBasedChat is a chat application built using Python that allows users to connect and communicate in real-time over the internet.

This application uses a client-server architecture, where the client is the browser-based Python chat interface, and the server is a Python server that handles the real-time communication between clients.

The project is open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/Alan3042/ServerBasedChat. Feel free to download and use the project code as a reference or contribute to the development of the application by submitting a pull request.
